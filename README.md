### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hey guys! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Lunar, my friend call me Redd. My name don't from of Lunar Client, but my head. Im passionate of Space, Electronic and Video Game. My first game is Minecraft, after 1 month
in this game, I found my better quality. I discovered the moderation, after that, I created my frist account on Discord the 27 june 2017. Discord is my first application
I the most use of my life. I created so much of server and doesn't worked. Also, I created a lot of bot Discord, and doesn't work too. I always found my place in the moderation
on Discord, Twitch and Minecraft.

ðŸ“· Twitch
I'm a little streamer French, I like play video game and doing something we never see on Twitch, do homework or something like that. So I have a server Minecraft for my
community and I very like developed this server. I can develop when Im lonely on the server and my friend can help me for testing the new function. I'm a streamer Canadian
and student in the same time. My project of streaming is to create a team of 4 streamer and create video and stream together for fun. I have already some friend in my head
for this project. My idea is to have a building for create a studio for any video, so create a studio for any video or stream on VR (Virtual Reality) or just for a simple 
stream on video game together.
